# This code is based on the example here:
# http://pika.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/asynchronous_consumer_example.html
# There are a few significant changes from the example having to do with queue
# type, reconnection upon initial errors connecting, etc.
#
# This queue consumer model assumes that we're doing bi-directional
# verification of all messages received. This means your message_callback
# had better be idempotent.
#
# To generate the amqp URL, see:
# https://pika.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/using_urlparameters.html
# Also note that in order to work correctly, you will almost certianly want to
# set the heartbeat to a positive value (say, 10 seconds).
